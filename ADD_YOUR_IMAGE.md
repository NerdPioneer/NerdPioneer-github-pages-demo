# Profile Image Carousel Setup ✨

## 🎉 Carousel is Active!

Your profile image carousel is now running with these amazing features:

### ✅ What's Working:
- **Auto-rotating carousel** - Changes every 4 seconds
- **Smooth fade transitions** - Elegant opacity and scale effects  
- **Hover pause** - Stops rotation when you hover over the image
- **Mobile optimized** - Touch-friendly with auto-resume after touch
- **Accessibility friendly** - Respects reduced motion preferences
- **Performance optimized** - Images are preloaded for smooth transitions

### 🖼️ Your Images:
- `profile_1.jpg` - First image (starts active)
- `profile_2.jpg` - Second image  
- `profile_3.jpg` - Third image

### 🎨 Visual Effects:
- **Subtle glow** during transitions
- **Smooth scaling** animations
- **Professional hover effects**
- **Responsive sizing** across all devices

### 📱 Responsive Behavior:
- **Desktop (1024px+):** 500×500px carousel
- **Tablet (768px-1024px):** 400×400px carousel
- **Mobile (480px-768px):** 300×300px carousel  
- **Small Mobile (320px-480px):** 250×250px carousel
- **Ultra-small (under 320px):** 200×200px carousel

### 🔧 How It Works:
1. All three images are loaded in the HTML
2. Only one is visible at a time (with `active` class)
3. JavaScript rotates through them every 4 seconds
4. CSS handles smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions
5. Hover detection pauses the carousel for better UX

### 🎯 Pro Features:
- **Smart preloading** - All images load immediately for zero lag
- **Mobile touch support** - Pauses on touch, resumes after 2 seconds
- **Accessibility** - Honors "prefers-reduced-motion" setting
- **Performance** - Uses CSS transforms and opacity for smooth animation
- **Browser optimized** - Handles backface visibility for better rendering
