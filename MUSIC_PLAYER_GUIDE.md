# Music Player Configuration Guide

Your website now includes a configurable music player! Here are three ways you can manage your playlist:

## Option 1: JSON File (Recommended) üìù

Edit the `playlist.json` file to add/remove tracks. This is the most flexible approach.

**Format:**
```json
{
  "playlist": [
    {
      "title": "Song Name",
      "artist": "Artist Name",
      "youtube": "https://youtube.com/watch?v=...",
      "apple": "https://music.apple.com/search?term=...",
      "spotify": "https://open.spotify.com/search/..."
    }
  ]
}
```

**To add a new song:**
1. Open `playlist.json`
2. Add a new object with the song details
3. Save the file
4. Refresh your website

## Option 2: Text File (Simple) üìÑ

Edit the `playlist.txt` file - it's easier to read and edit manually.

**Format:**
```
Song Title | Artist Name | YouTube URL | Apple Music URL | Spotify URL
```

**To add a new song:**
1. Open `playlist.txt`
2. Add a new line with your song details separated by ` | `
3. Save the file

## Option 3: Direct Code Edit üíª

If you prefer, you can edit the playlist directly in `script.js` in the `initMusicPlayer()` function.
